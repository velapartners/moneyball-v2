# Vela_Partners_Mirco_Internship

The 'Vela_Partners_Project.pdf' file provides an introdution to the project and analysis.

The notebooks with all the rough code written during the micro internship is 'Vela Partners Notebook.ipynb'. Idealy this notebook should not be used unless if there are errors with occur with the other notebooks. The other notebooks contain the code sligthly cleaned and with comments.

Idealy the 'Vela Partners  -Data Loading.ipynb' notebook should be ran first to load the datasets and structure it into one pandas dataframe. Then the 'Vela Partners - Feature Generation.ipynb' is ran to extract feature from the dataset. Lastly, 'Vela Partner - The Model.ipynb' notebook trains the models using the features created.
